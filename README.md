# About The Project

I developed this web application as a **personal project** during my time at the **University of Maryland**. As a computer science student focused on software engineering, I undertook this project with the goal of providing my fellow students with a valuable tool for selecting courses with the highest-rated professors. This application integrates data from two UMD API's to aggregate course-related information and acts as a supplemental tool for UMD students to build their schedules by finding the highest-rated professor for each selected course and respective section.

The motivation behind this project was to address a recurring problem I faced and other students faced about course quality and instructor ratings. During the student schedule building period, figuring out who were the best professors for the variety of courses that I wanted to take became a headache. Having to flip back and forth, open multiple tabs, ask fellow students about their previous experiences with a certain professor, and researching the acumen of a professor for a singular course wasn't fun or time efficient. Thus, I came up with UMD's Highest-Rated Professors Finder as a direct solution to this issue.

The application was built utilizing **Java** and **Spring Boot** to create a simple backend for data processing and functionality. The frontend was developed using **Vaadin**, which is a frontend framework specific to Java and this provided a minimalistic and user-friendly interface for students to conduct their searches. I decided to use Vaadin to quickly deploy this project and I will circle back to build out the frontend using React.

## Demonstration

We'll be using course codes CMSC216, CMSC351, and CMSC420 for this example.
> **Note:** Any course code currently being offered by UMD should work.

### Step 2
The course code "CMSC216" has been entered and searched. An interactive table is returned that displays the related professors in descending order. In this case, CMSC216 has two professors and their rating has been displayed next to their name. In addition to professor rating, all course sections are displayed with pertinent information such as location, meeting time, and remaining seats available.
> **Note**: Professors are rated on a scale between 1-5, 5 being the best.

### Step 3
The next course code "CMSC351" has now been entered and searched. The results are populated sequentially and gives the user the ability to navigate multiple classes at once. Here we see three professors teach CMSC351 and all of their respective ratings and course details have been provided.

### Step 4
Now, the course code "CMSC420" has been entered and searched to simply show the stacking/building nature of this project. The purpose of this feature is to allow students to navigate and make decisions from one tab/screen.
